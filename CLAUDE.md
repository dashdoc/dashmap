## Frontend

Use Chakra UI as the base component library.
Read backend/API_DOC.md to understand the backend API.

## Backend

Use `uv` for dependencies management.
DO NOT INSTALL django-rest-framework, keep it simple base Django only.

Always update backend/API_DOC.md whenever you change the API.
Always add or update backend tests when you work on the API. Run them to verify that everything works correctly.
Make sure to update the reset_db.py command when you change the data model.
